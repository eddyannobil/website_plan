1.”Rain beats the leopards skin but it does not wash out the spots”.

No matter how hard you try, you cannot change another person’s character. Similarly, if you behave badly and develop a poor reputation, it’s difficult to change other people’s opinions of you, regardless of how many good deeds you perform.

2.”No matter how hot your anger is it cannot cook yams”.

While anger can prompt a positive action that may resolve an issue, the act of getting angry resolves nothing.

3.”A roaring lion kills no game”.

Sitting around and talking about something gains nothing. The saying also implies that you should work towards your goals quietly rather than bragging about your achievements prematurely

4.”Do not call the forest that shelters you a jungle”.

Do not disrespect or insult someone who shares your burdens and responsibilities or who takes care of you.

5.”Rain does not fall on one roof alone”.

Trouble does not discriminate. It comes to everyone at some point.
